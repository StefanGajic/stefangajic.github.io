          <h1 class="mb-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>

          <p>The terms and conditions outlined below apply to all coaching services provided by <strong>Stefan DeskStrong</strong>, including but not limited to posture and mobility coaching, training plans, and all related communication (email, video, and other platforms).</p>

          <p>By accessing or purchasing any of our services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and enter into a coaching agreement with <strong>Stefan DeskStrong</strong> (the “Coach” or “Company”).</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">1. Nature of Services</h4>
          <p>DeskStrong programs are designed to support your physical well-being through posture improvement, mobility enhancement, and movement education. The services provided are for educational and coaching purposes only and are not intended to be a substitute for professional mental health care, physical therapy, or medical treatment.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">2. Health Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>By signing up, you confirm that you are physically able to participate in basic physical movement and exercises. If you have any known medical conditions, injuries, or limitations, it is your responsibility to consult a healthcare provider before beginning any coaching plan. Participation is at your own risk.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">3. Communication & Support</h4>
          <p>All communication is delivered via the chosen platforms (email, Zoom, messaging apps, etc.). The level and frequency of support depend on the plan you’ve enrolled in. We aim to respond to all messages within 24–48 business hours.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">4. Payments & Refunds</h4>
          <p>All services are billed in advance. Due to the digital and time-committed nature of coaching, refunds are not issued once the program has started. If you’re unsure, we recommend starting with a free intro call to determine fit.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">5. Cancellations & Rescheduling</h4>
          <p>Coaching sessions must be canceled or rescheduled at least 24 hours in advance. Missed sessions without notice may be forfeited.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">6. Confidentiality</h4>
          <p>Your privacy is respected. All personal information shared during coaching is kept confidential and not shared with any third party, unless required by law.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">7. Intellectual Property</h4>
          <p>All coaching materials, videos, plans, and resources provided are the intellectual property of Stefan DeskStrong and are intended for personal use only. Redistribution, resale, or duplication without written permission is prohibited.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">8. Updates to Terms</h4>
          <p>These terms may be updated at any time without notice. It is your responsibility to review them periodically. Continued use of services after changes indicates acceptance.</p>
